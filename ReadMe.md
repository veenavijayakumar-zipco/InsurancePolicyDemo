 Assume an insurance policy for X amount (SumAssured). 
 User pays a certain premium amount for Y years (PolicyPayingTerm) in a frequency of their choice (monthly/quarterly/half yearly/yearly) 
 Once the PolicyPaymentTerm is over, they get a certain payout amount for the next Z years (PolicyPayoutTerm)

 System should calculate the Premuim Amount, Payout Amount and Dates on which the premium/payouts should happen
    PremiumAmount = SumAssured/Total no. of premiums in PolicyPayingTerm
    PayoutAmount = SumAssured/PolicyPayoutTerm
